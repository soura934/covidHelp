# NYteams

## Background
I love sports and I only support ny teams across all leagues. I figured out that it would be great idea if I and my fellow ny fans have one place where we can have a specific site to show the score and result of any ny team game.

## Technologies
- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML & CSS
- Webpack to bundle

## Functionality & MVP
- The app will show the score and details of a particular ny team 
- The app will have a recap video of the game if available
- Search bar to search infos for a particular ny team

## Implementation Timeline
- Day 1: Research for an API and probably more technology to use like canvas
- Day 2: Render the boxes that contain each teams info
- Day 3: Make sure each box will give more info on a click
- Day 4: Go over the functionality of the app and if more is needed
- Day 5: Styling fix bugs
