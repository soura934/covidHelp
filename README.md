# Covid Stats

## Background 
We are living in a difficult time where the pandemic has changed our life. I figured out that it would be a great idea if we have a specific site to provide helpful info during this covid era.

## Technologies
- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML & CSS
- Webpack to bundle

## Functionality & MVP
- The app will show the covid stats of each country of the world
- The app will have a graph that shows the number of death 
- The app will provide the number of people who recover around the world

## Implementation Timeline
- Day 1: Research for an API and probably more technology to use like D3.js
- Day 2: Render a graph 
- Day 3: Make sure each box will give more info on a click
- Day 4: Go over the functionality of the app and if more is needed
- Day 5: Styling fix bugs
